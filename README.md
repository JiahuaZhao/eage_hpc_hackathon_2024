# EAGE HPC Workshop Hackathon 2024
## Exploring embeddings for pre-stack seismic data

The provided starting notebook enables reading samples of field marine and land data.

The participants are encouraged to to develop methods seeking for better embedding size to reconstruction accuracy ratio as well as downstream applications of the embedded data.
